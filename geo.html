        <h2>What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?</h2>
        <p class="muted">GEO is the practice of preparing your company's content and online signals so that generative AI platforms (like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) can pick, quote, and recommend you when someone asks for industry advice. Think of GEO as the successor to traditional SEO — but focused on how AI understands, trusts, and cites your brand.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How GEO is different from classic SEO</h2>
        <p>SEO is about ranking pages on search results. GEO is about <strong>being referenced inside AI answers</strong>. Rather than chasing a keyword position, GEO concentrates on three layers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Context signals</strong> — content that directly matches the intent of conversational queries.</li>
          <li><strong>Content intelligence</strong> — clarity and structure that make it easy for models to extract facts and recommendations.</li>
          <li><strong>Credibility layers</strong> — external validation such as citations, thought leadership pieces, and consistent brand mentions that build trust.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why B2B companies must care</h2>
        <p>Buying cycles in B2B are long, involve multiple stakeholders, and are highly research-driven. Many decision-makers now start with an AI chat instead of ten different web searches. If your firm is not visible in those AI-led conversations, you risk losing early-stage consideration — the stage when buyers narrow down options.</p>
        <p>Here are the clearest reasons GEO matters for B2B:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>First-point discovery:</strong> Executives use conversational AI as an initial research tool.</li>
          <li><strong>Authority amplification:</strong> Being referenced by AI feels like a third-party endorsement.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost efficiency:</strong> GEO can reduce dependence on short-term paid campaigns by building long-term AI visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Opportunity for specialists:</strong> Niche and mid-market firms can compete by demonstrating deep knowledge—not just ad spend.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical GEO steps for B2B teams</h2>
        <p>Start small and practical. Below are clear actions you can take right away.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Build conversational content:</strong> Write clear Q&amp;A pages, short explainers, and buyer-scenario guides that match the way people ask questions naturally.</li>
          <li><strong>Create knowledge assets:</strong> Publish whitepapers, short case studies, and industry playbooks that list measurable outcomes (numbers matter).</li>
          <li><strong>Optimize entities:</strong> Make sure your company name, product names, and leaders are consistently described across web pages and business listings so AI models can link them to your domain of expertise.</li>
          <li><strong>Earn citations:</strong> Publish in industry media, do guest pieces, and get referenced by analysts. These external signals boost how AI platforms judge credibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor and iterate:</strong> Track when AI platforms mention you and which knowledge assets are being used. Improve those assets based on gaps you observe.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Who should lead GEO inside a B2B firm?</h2>
        <p>GEO is cross-functional. It sits at the intersection of marketing, product, and sales. Typical owners include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Head of Content or Content Lead — for knowledge creation</li>
          <li>SEO/Organic Growth — for technical markup and discoverability</li>
          <li>Product Marketing — for positioning and outcome metrics</li>
          <li>PR or Communications — for building credibility and second-party mentions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, these teams can create a repeatable GEO playbook that feeds AI-ready content into the market.</p>

        <h2>When to hire a Generative Engine Optimization partner</h2>
        <p>If your team is stretched or GEO feels technically unfamiliar, a specialist partner can accelerate the learning curve. A partner brings a mix of AI-savvy content strategy, entity mapping, and outreach expertise so you get visible sooner.</p>

        <h2>Quick FAQ</h2>
        <h3>How soon will GEO show results?</h3>
        <p class="muted">GEO is not an overnight fix. Expect initial signals in a few weeks, with stronger AI references forming over months as your content earns citations and authority.</p>
        <h3>Is GEO only for large companies?</h3>
        <p class="muted">No. Niche and mid-market B2B firms can benefit quickly by publishing highly specific, outcome-focused assets that AI models prefer to cite.</p>
        <h3>Do I still need SEO?</h3>
        <p class="muted">Yes. GEO complements SEO. Traditional organic search drives web traffic, while GEO ensures you appear in AI-led discovery moments.</p>
